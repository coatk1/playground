    "# Classes and Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "* Objects hold variables/features (called properties) - such as eye color, or breed and functions/actions (called methods) - such as bark and eat.\n",
    "* Class -- or the blueprint from which that object is constructed by the computer, it describes the methods (functions) and properties (variables) that will exist in an object when it's created.\n",
    "* When we create an object of a class in memory, this is called instantiation or an instance of a class.\n",
    "* __init__/ constructor, describes how to create an object based on the blueprint provided by the class.\n",
    "* self is a keyword used in classes to refer to the specific object built from the class, keep track of its own properties, separate from any other object of the same class.\n",
    "* classes are groups of data and actions, data attached to classes are key-value pairs called Properties, and the actions that class can take are called Methods.\n",
    "* Scope and encapsulation can be thought as useful features that allow us to compartmentalize code instead of providing a measure of security. Prevent people from trying to access areas of memory that shouldn't be accessed or edited arbitrarily.\n",
    "* 'lexical/local scope' which means the values are only available from within that function.\n",
    "* 'global scope' which means we have access to that variables globally.\n",
    "* subclass and it will inherit everything from its superclass.\n",
    "* Polymorphism basically allows us to use different implementations of the same method.\n",
    "* Method overriding and it is a form of Polymorphism. It allows you to specify a different functionality for methods that are inherited from the superclass.\n",
    "* Aggregation does not inherit the class methods, but contains the class's objects.\n",
    "* Another way to think about it is that inheritance vs aggregation is \"isa\" vs. \"hasa\".\n",
